SNES9X 1.43 GX Edition

Please, keep the source code when you make any changes, this is an open source
project.

All of you know how great it is playing SNES games on the Nintendo Gamecube,
it's awesome to play the games that made us have a lot of fun in our childhood.

The version of this emulator was unupdated and almost forgotten, but (for me, 
it's more) playable, and no body wanted to do something about it, so I decided 
to make some changes to bring it to life, even if someone dislike it or if 
it's an unofficial release.

Source code is available at Google Code
(http://code.google.com/p/snes9xgx143/).

- Added Save state in Zip mode for SD Gecko and Memory Card. Source mainly taken
  from SnesGX 2.0b8 [beta]

+[dsbomb]
- GC: fixed DVD support, can read ROMs and ZIPs.

Version 0.0.9 [20080325]
- Added SDCARD slot selection for searching roms, meaning, you can search roms 
  from SDCARD SLOT A or SLOT B (Beta, meaning, buggy, but works).
- For standarization, you must create folders root:\snes9x\roms to read SNES 
  roms files from SDCARD.
- Added combo L+R+X+Y to call menu.

Version 0.0.8 [20080222]
- Fixed displaying information about a ROM file (oops!)

  Load SRAM, Return to previous.

Version 0.0.7 [20080127]
- Add SD card subdirectory browsing:
  + Set the cursor over [..] and push A button to browse.

- Modified controls when going into the rom selection menu (DVD or 
  SDCARD):  [ala eke-eke style]
  + Use B to quit selection list.
  + Use L/R triggrers or Pad Left/Right to go down/up one full page.

- Some menu rearrangment and a little of sourcecode cleanup: 
  + Everytime you pressed B button on any option, playgame started, not anymore
  until you select Play Game option.

  after first reading.
